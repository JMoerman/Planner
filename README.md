# Planner
This application doesn't yet have a name, if you come up with something nice, please let me know!

This is a simple application for managing tasks for each day of the month.

## Features:
- Two levels of important: normal and important.
- Two kinds of tasks, one type of task that will only display on the configured days, and one that continues to display if you weren't able to finish it the day before.

A lot of work still needs to be done, as only basic functionality has been implemented.

(The tasks are stored in ~/.Todo/daily.xml, you can't change this right now.)

## Planned features:
- Settings
- Option to launch an other application when the last (important) task is finished.
- Statistics: How much you got done for the last week.
- Focus mode: blocking distractive sites untill you're done with your important tasks.
- Borrowing the timer from _Go For It!_? (Look [here]https://github.com/mank319/Go-For-It/ for this awesome little application.)
- Synchronisation
